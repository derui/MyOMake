MyOMake
=======

My OMakefiles to be used to my OCaml products

When use script in this project, checkout MyOMake as a **submodule** into your project, then you copy default OMakeroot and OMakefile from submodule as you like.

After write it to OMakeroot, you write `open MyOCaml' or others into your OMakefile when want to use them.
